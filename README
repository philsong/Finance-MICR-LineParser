Finance::MICR::LineParser
=========================

Parse a MICR Line code into parts. Additionally tell us if a string garble contains a MICR code.
If you have a string and want to parse it as a check's MICR line, this is useful.

I am presently using this module to let the office scan in documents and using gocr, I get a string
out of the scanned check image. Then with this module I parse the MICR line- if one is there.
I name the documents for archiving after the MICR code.
